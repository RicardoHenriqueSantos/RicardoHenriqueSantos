### Hello World :alien: 

### I'm a programming student with a strong focus on Python and SQL. I'm always eager to learn more and currently expanding my knowledge to include Java, NoSQL, and front-end development. I'm excited about the possibilities of what I can create with these new skills and can't wait to see where my programming journey takes me. :computer:
